### Tappy Plane is a fast-focus, tap-to-fly mini-challenge where your tiny plane squeezes through impossible gaps

#### A flappy-bird-ish project forces you to wrestle with physics, timing, and game loops while the stakes stay as low as a derpy bird bonking into pipes. It’s a perfect training montage: simple enough not to break your spirit, tricky enough to sharpen your developer reflexes.
